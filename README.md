# Pythagorean Expectation in Sports
Basic sports analytics using Pythagorean-expectation that can be used to learn sports analytics. This includes code in python along with notebooks and some R code.

## About Pythagorean expectation
The name comes from its resembelance to the Pythagoras Theorem in math (One of the core fundamental prequisites of learning about statistics|probability|random variables along with linear algebra, trig etc.). The formula is as follows:

The Pythagorean expectation, developed by Bill James in the early 1980s, is a baseball statistic that attempts to measure how many runs teams should have scored based on their overall performance. This metric combines both offensive and defensive statistics, such as batting average and earned run average (ERA), to determine an expected number of runs scored or prevented. The Pythagorean premise is that a team‚Äôs run differential should equal the number of runs expected from its performance. In sports, this theorem can be applied to any sport where teams score points and has quickly become one of the most important metrics in sports analytics. The concept has also been adapted into other sports such as cricket, football/soccer, basketball, hockey, and football. By combining numerical data, sports analytics can provide a more comprehensive understanding of each team‚Äôs performance and the overall outcome of sports games. As sports evolve, so does sports analytics; understanding Pythagorean expectation is an essential part of today‚Äôs sports analytics landscape

In sum, the Pythagorean expectation is a sports statistic that combines both offensive and defensive statistics to calculate how many runs/points/goals teams should have scored based on their performance. This metric is widely used in sports analytics
